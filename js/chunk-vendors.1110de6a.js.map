In other words,\n// it is the module they are interfacing with when they import from the whole\n// package instead of from a submodule, like this:\n//\n// ```js\n// import { map } from 'underscore';\n// ```\n//\n// The difference with `./index-default`, which is the package entry point for\n// CommonJS, AMD and UMD users, is purely technical. In ES modules, named and\n// default exports are considered to be siblings, so when you have a default\n// export, its properties are not automatically available as named exports. For\n// this reason, we re-export the named exports in addition to providing the same\n// default export as in `./index-default`.\n\n\n\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 1 */\n/***/ (function(module, __webpack_exports__, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\"use strict\";\n/* WEBPACK VAR INJECTION */(function(global) {/* harmony export (binding) */ __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, \"e\", function() { return VERSION; });\n/* harmony export (binding) */ __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, \"p\", function() { return root; });\n/* harmony export (binding) */ __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, \"a\", function() { return ArrayProto; });\n/* harmony export (binding) */ __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, \"c\", function() { return ObjProto; });\n/* harmony export (binding) */ __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, \"d\", function() { return SymbolProto; });\n/* harmony export (binding) */ __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, \"o\", function() { return push; });\n/* harmony export (binding) */ __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, \"q\", function() { return slice; });\n/* harmony export (binding) */ __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, \"t\", function() { return toString; });\n/* harmony export (binding) */ __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, \"i\", function() { return hasOwnProperty; });\n/* harmony export (binding) */ __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, \"r\", function() { return supportsArrayBuffer; });\n/* harmony export (binding) */ __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, \"s\", function() { return supportsDataView; });\n/* harmony export (binding) */ __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, \"k\", function() { return nativeIsArray; });\n/* harmony export (binding) */ __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, \"m\", function() { return nativeKeys; });\n/* harmony export (binding) */ __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, \"j\", function() { return nativeCreate; });\n/* harmony export (binding) */ __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, \"l\", function() { return nativeIsView; });\n/* harmony export (binding) */ __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, \"g\", function() { return _isNaN; });\n/* harmony export (binding) */ __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, \"f\", function() { return _isFinite; });\n/* harmony export (binding) */ __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, \"h\", function() { return hasEnumBug; });\n/* harmony export (binding) */ __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, \"n\", function() { return nonEnumerableProps; });\n/* harmony export (binding) */ __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, \"b\", function() { return MAX_ARRAY_INDEX; });\n// Current version.\nvar VERSION = '1.12.1';\n\n// Establish the root object, `window` (`self`) in the browser, `global`\n// on the server, or `this` in some virtual machines.
